Layer and frills are in this spring with many designer collections already displaying lightweight, brightly colored layers. This year designers are focusing on elaborate and well put together looks and there is no better way to achieve that than by getting all dolled up in a frilled, multi layer outfit. Try a frilly but grownup look like this bright white top.



9. Lightweight Knits

Lightweight knits are making a comeback. Once popular in the late eighties and early nineties, lightweight knits are showing up on runways all over the world again and people are loving it. They’re breathable, fashionable and help avoid farmer’s tans and sunburns.

6. Feather Trim

Feather trim is fun and cute. There I said, I said what we’ve all been thinking. For a long time this sort of trim was mostly considered a younger person’s look, even mostly for children, but now its popping up on hats, handbags and even shirts.



5. Well Fitted Jackets

As you can tell this season is all about intention and coordination. Shabby chic is definitely out and thus so are loose fitting jackets. A nice form-fitting, season-appropriate jacket is what you need to pull your look together this spring.



4. Leather

Leather might seem a bit counter-intuitive for springtime, but this year brightly colored leathers are showing up on all kinds of spring friendly vests, skirts, and accessories. Brown and burgundy seem to be the popular colors at the moment, but they will move into the background as spring moves onto the scene.



3. High-Waisted Jeans

In keeping with the theme of tidy and well put together, jumpsuits are a major trend this summer. While some have chosen more decorative accessories many are embracing the elegant simplicity of the jumpsuit and are simply paring them with a favorite pair of casual shoes.



1. Neons
